        <br>

        <p id="CSText">The Problem</p>

        <br>

        <p id="CSText">In the rural communities of South Africa, access to education and job opportunitites is very
            limited due to the lack of digital skills. Many community members, particularly women and young adults, do
            not have basic computer literacy, making it difficult to participate in the modern economy. Local
            governments and NGOs struggled to address this gap because of a lack of infrastructure and resources.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p id="CSText">The Solution</p>

        <br>

        <p id="CSText">Code For All partnered with the Code4SA Foundation to develop and implement a digital literacy
            program for rural areas in South Africa. The program included:</p>

        <br>

        <ul>

            <li>
                <p id="CSText">On-site training workshops in basic computer skills, including email usage, internet
                    browsing, and word processing.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p id="CSText">Donations of refurbished laptops and installation of free, open-source software.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p id="CSText">Online learning portals that allowed participants to continue their education after the
                    workshops.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p id="CSText">Train-the-trainer initiatives, empowering local leaders to continue the digital literacy
                    efforts after our team completed the initial workshops.</p>
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h6 id="CS-Subtitle">Client: Code4SA</h6>

        <br>

        <p id="CSText">The Problem</p>

        <br>

        <p id="CSText">In South Africa, many civil society organizations (CSOs) and journalists were struggling to use
            data effectively in their work. Although public data was available, there was a gap in skills needed to
            analyze, interpret, and present this data for advocacy and decision-making. This led to missed opportunities
            for these groups to influence policy and hold public officials accountable.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p id="CSText">The Solution</p>

        <br>
